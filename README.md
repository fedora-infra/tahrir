Tahrir is [Arabic for Liberation][wikipedia-tahrir]

## Contributing

Welcome! Thank you for taking the time to contribute. This project relies on an active and involved community, and we really appreciate your support.

### Quickstart

1. Look for an [existing issue](https://github.com/fedora-infra/tahrir/issues)
   about the bug or feature you're interested in. If you can't find an existing issue, create a [new one](https://github.com/fedora-infra/tahrir/issues/new).

2. Fork the [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/fedora-infra/tahrir).

3. Fix the bug or add the feature, and then write one or more tests which show the bug is fixed or the feature works.

4. Submit a pull request and wait for a maintainer to review it.

More detailed guidelines to help ensure your submission goes smoothly are below.

### Guidelines

#### Python Support

Tahrir supports Python 2.7 version. This is automatically enforced by the continuous integration (CI) suite.

#### Code Style

We follow the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide
for Python. This is automatically enforced by the CI suite.

#### Tests

The test suites can be run using [tox](http://tox.readthedocs.io/) by simply
running ``tox`` from the repository root. We aim for all code to have test coverage or be explicitly marked as not covered using the ``# no-qa`` comment. We encourage the [Test Driven Development Practice](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/testfirst.html)

Your pull request should contain tests for your new feature or bug fix. If you're not certain how to write tests, we will be happy to help you.

#### Setup a local development environment

To quickly start hacking on Tahrir, we provide a vagrant setup.

1. Set up tinystage (if you haven't already) and ensure the base boxes are running.

   https://github.com/fedora-infra/tiny-stage

   This sets up the infrastructure to use things like authentication and Fedora Messaging when developing on Tahrir

2. Clone the repository to your local storage and run

   ```
   vagrant up
   ```

3. Tahrir frontend should now be available on https://badges.tinystage.test.
